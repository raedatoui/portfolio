  # Choose what kind of storage to use for this uploader:

    "uploads/posts/#{model.id}"
  end

  # Create different versions of your uploaded files:
  version :fill do
    process :resize_to_fill => [300, 300]
  end

  version :limit do
    process :resize_to_limit => [300, 300]
  end

  # Add a white list of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
  # For images you might use something like this:
  def extension_white_list
    Ckeditor.image_file_types
  end
